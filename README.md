# Pantomime - An ncurses MPD client

Pantomime is a simple ncurses-based MPD client. Currently it supports viewing and manipulating MPD's play queue.

This is a learning project and is not meant to be feature-complete.
The code itself is a bit overly-documented, as I'm also using this opportunity
to learn how [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) works.
